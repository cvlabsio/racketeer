The goal of this project is to provide a way for teams to simulate and test detection of common ransomware operation, in a controlled manner, against a set of company assets and network endpoints. 

## Deployment model
The Racketeer toolkit operates on an agent/base model and currently supports Windows OS systems at the agent level, while the command and control base cross platform.
